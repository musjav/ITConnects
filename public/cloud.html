                        <b>What is Cloud Computing?</b>
                        <br><br>

                        Cloud computing is a general term for the delivery of hosted services over the internet. It
                        enables companies to consume a compute resource, such as a virtual machine (VM’s), storage
                        or an
                        application, as a utility just like electricity, rather than having to build and maintain
                        computing infrastructures in house.
                        <br><br>

                        Cloud computing boasts several attractive benefits for businesses and end users.

                            SaaS is a distribution model that delivers software applications over the internet.
                            These
                            applications are often called web services and users can access SaaS applications and
                            services from any location using their computer or mobile device that has internet
                            access.
                            <br><br>
                            SaaS removes the need for organizations to install and run applications on their own
                            computers or in their own data centers. This eliminates the expense of hardware
                            acquisition,
                            provisioning and maintenance, as well as software licensing, installation and support.

                        <p>IaaS provider’s supply a virtual server instance and storage. Users have an allocated
                            storage
                            capacity and can start, stop, access and configure the VM and storage as desired. These
                            are
                            small, medium, large and extra-large instances which allows the customer to pick it as
                            per
                            his requirement.
                            <br><br>
                            IaaS platforms offer highly scalable resources that can be adjusted on-demand. This
                            makes
                            IaaS well-suited for workloads that are temporary, experimental or change unexpectedly.

                            IaaS customers pay on a per-use basis, typically by the hour, week or month. Some
                            providers
                            also charge customers based on the amount of virtual machine space they use. This
                            pay-as-you-go model eliminates the capital expense of deploying in-house hardware and
                            software.

            </h3>
            <div class="row gx-0">
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <ul>

                        <p>Platform as a service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model that delivers applications over
                            the
                            Internet. In a PaaS model, a cloud provider delivers hardware and software tools,
                            usually
                            those needed for application development to its users as a service. A PaaS provider
                            hosts
                            the hardware and software on its own infrastructure. As a result, PaaS frees users from
                            having to install in-house hardware and software to develop or run a new application.
                            <br><br>
                            PaaS does not typically replace a business entire infrastructure. Instead, a business
                            relies
                            on PaaS providers for key services, such as Java development or application hosting. For
                            example, deploying a typical business tool locally might require an IT team to buy and
                            install hardware, operating systems, middleware (such as databases, Web servers and so
                            on)
                            the actual application, define user access or security, and then add the application to
                            existing systems management or application performance monitoring (APM) tools. IT teams
                            must
                            then maintain all of these resources over time.
                            <br><br>
                            PaaS supports all the underlying computing and software; and users only need to log in
                            and
                            start using the platform (usually through a Web browser interface).
